Sure! Here is a sample README for your script:

# Large File Scanner

This script scans a specified directory and its subdirectories for files larger than a specified size and prints their paths and sizes in a human-readable format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `os` module (standard library)
- `humanize` module

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install the required `humanize` module if you don't have it already:

```sh
pip install humanize
```

## Usage

1. Open the script file (`large_file_scanner.py`) in a text editor.

2. Modify the `min_size` and `path` variables in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to suit your needs:

    - `min_size`: The minimum file size to look for, specified in megabytes (MB). The default is set to 2048 MB (2 GB).
    - `path`: The directory path to scan. The default is set to `C:\\` (the C drive on Windows). Change this to the drive or directory you want to scan.

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        min_size = 2048 * 1024 * 1024  # This is the size in MB
        path = "C:\\"  # Change this to the directory you want to scan
    ```

3. Save the changes and run the script:

```sh
python large_file_scanner.py
```

4. The script will output the number of large files found and list them with their paths and sizes.

## Example Output

```
Scanning for large files...
Found 5 files larger than 2.0 GB:
C:\path\to\largefile1: 2.1 GB
C:\path\to\largefile2: 2.5 GB
...
```

## Error Handling

The script handles `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError` exceptions that may occur during file size retrieval. If these errors are encountered, the script will skip the problematic files and continue scanning.
